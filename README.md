# j_project_api

## üî∏Automated testing framework developed for the J.* project, a B2C web application that serves as a dynamic platform for creative professionals

üî∏ Includes:

- sets of both positive and negative tests to validate API functionality across core features (e.g.user registration, authorization, password recovery, and account deletion)
- a suite of basic fixtures to streamline the setup of preconditions and teardown of postconditions
- helper classes featuring methods for specialized tasks, like accessing and parsing email-received information for test use, or executing complex multi-step processes needed in tests

‚ñ∂Ô∏è To run the framework:
- clone it from the current repository to your local machine
- install all necessary packages and modules by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in PyCharm's Terminal
- (!) an .env file with access credentials is required to run tests

‚ñ∂Ô∏è To run tests for API:
- (for all tests) execute `pytest ./api/tests` in PyCharm's Terminal
- (for specific test): run pytest `./api/[name_of_specific_test_file].py`
- (for all tests with specific mark): `pytest -m [title_of_specific_mark]`
